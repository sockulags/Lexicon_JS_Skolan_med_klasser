The assignment is to create a school system using JavaScript classes to practice object-oriented programming. Here's a summary of the tasks:

1. **Create a School class:**
   - Instanciate variables: `name`, `address`, `zipcode`, `city`, `students` (empty array), and `teachers` (empty array).

   ```javascript
   class School {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
       this.students = [];
       this.teachers = [];
       // other properties...
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Create a Subject class:**
   - Instanciate variables: `name`, `students` (empty array), and `teacher` (empty object).

   ```javascript
   class Subject {
     // code...
   }
   ```

3. **Create a Student class:**
   - Instanciate variables: `name`, `age`, `gender`, and `subjects` (empty array).

   ```javascript
   class Student {
     // code...
   }
   ```

4. **Create a Teacher class:**
   - Instanciate variables: `name` and `subjects` (empty array).

   ```javascript
   class Teacher {
     // code...
   }
   ```

5. **Create instances:**
   - Create instances of `School`, three instances of `Subject`, five instances of `Student`, and two instances of `Teacher`. Be creative with variable names.

6. **Add a subject to a teacher's array:**
   - Use `push()` or `unshift()` to add a subject to a teacher's array. Print both the teacher and the subject in the console.

7. **Add a student to a subject's student array:**
   - Solve the issue by adding a reference on both sides (circular reference). Create a function `addSubjectToTeacher` to establish this connection.

8. **Create and explain methods:**
   - Create and place methods `addTeacher`, `enlistToSubject`, `addStudent`, and `addSubject` in the appropriate classes.

9. **Explore and test methods:**
   - Play around with the methods in the console, adding and removing instances.

10. **Additional methods:**
    - Create methods like `quitSubject`, `removeTeacher`, `relegateStudent`, and `fireTeacher`. Consider handling connections between classes properly.

11. **Logical connections:**
    - Implement logic at the end of the script file to connect students to the school, subjects to students, and teachers to subjects.

12. **Display functions:**
    - Create a standalone function `displayAllStudents` to loop through all students in the school and print their details.

13. **More display functions:**
    - Create functions like `displayAllSubjectsOfStudent`, `displayAllStudentsEnlistedToSubject`, and `displayAllTeachers`.

14. **Introduce a Grade class:**
    - Add a new class for grades with appropriate variables and methods. Consider relationships with other classes.

15. **Experiment and inspect:**
    - Play around with the new class and its methods in the console.

This assignment aims to reinforce understanding of class syntax, relationships between classes, and the principles of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
